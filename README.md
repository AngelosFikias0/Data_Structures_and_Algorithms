# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This project is a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. It includes detailed implementations and example usage for Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees (BST), Heaps, Hashtables, QuickSort, and Binary Search.

## Introduction

This project is designed to help understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java. Each data structure includes methods for standard operations, along with example code demonstrating their usage.

## Features

- **Linked List**
  - Add elements to the beginning, end, or at a specific position
  - Delete elements from the beginning, end, or at a specific position
  - Traverse the list

- **Stack**
  - Push elements onto the stack
  - Pop elements from the stack
  - Peek at the top element

- **Queue**
  - Enqueue elements
  - Dequeue elements
  - Traverse the queue

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
  - Insert elements
  - Delete elements
  - Search for elements
  - In-order traversal

- **Heap**
  - Insert elements
  - Remove the root element
  - Display elements

- **Hashtable**
  - Put elements into the hashtable
  - Get elements from the hashtable
  - Remove elements from the hashtable
  - Traverse the hashtable

- **QuickSort and BinarySearch**
  - Sort an array using QuickSort
  - Search for a value in a sorted array using BinarySearch
